# YACC programs
This repository consists of perfectly running yacc programs which I learnt during my Compiler Design Course
This repository contains the directories that contain a lex and yacc code pairs that solve a specific problem.
*The directory name is the purpose of the codes *
These codes might even help you during your compiler design course's lab session 
Thank you for visiting ❤️
